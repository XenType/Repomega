Internal fields will use transformToProperty and/or tranformToField
- if not password
    - if toField only, use on passed value and compare to persisted value
    - if ToProperty is present, ignore toField then use on persistValue and compare to passed value
- if password
    - if ToField only, use on passed value and compare to persisted value
    - if ToProperty is present, ignore ToField 
    - if ToProperty is present, ignore toField then use on persistValue
        - for password the transform function should return true or false, 
        not the password's value

OmegaObject.verifyInternalField
- use repo's retrieveOneValue method
- tests should include
    - 'normal'
    - transforms
    - verify works with locked fields (other?)

OmegaObject.saveInternalField
- use repo's persistValue method
- tests should include
    - 'normal'
    - transforms
    - verify does not work with locked fields (others?)
